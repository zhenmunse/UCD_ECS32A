# ECS 32A – Unit 1 Introduction

## Welcome to ECS 32A
- **Course goal**: Learn how to write programs from scratch, with no prior programming experience.
- Programming = a new language → requires practice & collaboration.
- Students come from diverse majors; programming is a general problem-solving tool.

> “Computer science is the new math.” – Christos Papadimitriou

## Why Learn to Program?
- Computers are used in almost every field.
- Programming goes beyond spreadsheets:
  - Handle data not in the right format.
  - Create tools not available off the shelf.
- Even if this is your last CS course, you’ll leave with:
  - A **powerful, flexible, free tool**.
  - An analytical skill to add to your resume.

---

## Why Python?
- **Portability**: Runs on most platforms; free & accessible.
- **Readability**: Shorter, simpler syntax.
  - *“Code is more often read than written.” – Guido van Rossum*
- **Developer productivity**:
  - Interpreted (no compiling step).
  - Large ecosystem of modules (graphics, data science, ML, web, etc.).
- **Popularity**: Used at Google, YouTube, NASA, Tesla, Pixar, etc.
- **Comparison**: Python programs are 3–10× shorter than Java or C++.

## Python & AI
- AI chatbots are good at Python → helps you code faster.
- Limitation:
  - Errors on complex tasks.
  - Stunts critical thinking if overused.
- In this course:
  - Learn Python **yourself**.
  - AI is **not allowed during exams**.

---

## Tools: IDLE & Jupyter
- **IDLE**: Integrated Development and Learning Environment
  - Shell: interactive line-by-line execution.
  - Script editor: write, save, and run full programs.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**:
  - Learned in discussion sections.
  - Popular in AI/ML and data science.

---

## Computer Model Recap
- **CPU**: asks “What next?” billions of times/sec.
- **Main memory**: fast, temporary (lost without power).
- **Secondary memory**: long-term storage.
- **Network**: remote storage/retrieval.
- **I/O devices**: keyboard, screen, etc.
- Programming = orchestrating all these resources with instructions.

---

## Interpreter vs Compiler
- **Interpreter**: Converts high-level → machine code *line by line* (Python).
- **Compiler**: Converts once → optimized machine code file (C, C++).
- Python = interpreted → fast to write & test.
